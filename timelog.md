## Week 3

### 3 Oct 2022

* *3 hours* Read through both seed papers and made a few notes.
* *1 hour* Downloaded and reviewed project template.
* *1 hour* Wrote up some discussion bullet points for my first meeting with my supervisor, and questions about seed papers and deep learning.

### 4 Oct 2022

* *1.5 hours* Initial meeting with supervisor (Kevin) and Alexandros (similar project with protein domains). Discussed previous research published that is similar to this project, what proteins are and discussed potential first initial plans.

### 11 Oct 2022

* *1.5 hours* Went through the introduction lectures for the first week of the Deep Learning (M) course.
* *0.5 hour* Set-up new Google account for using Google Colab with Jupyter notebooks.
* *2.5 hours* Went through the introductory deep learning with PyTorch document: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html.

### 13 Oct 2022

* *1 hour* Explored GraphQL documentation.

### 14 Oct 2022

* *1 hour* Met with Kevin to discuss project. Helped me get a clearer understanding of deep learning. Discussed viable technologies. 
* *1 hour* Created minutes from this which lets me see my long-term goals and what I want to complete next week.

### 17 Oct 2022

* *1 hour* Went through lab 1 part 1, the 60 minute blitz tutorial, again.
* *1.5 hours* Went through lab 1 part 2 which was a Jupyter notebook on PyTorch basics. 

### 18 Oct 2022

* *3 hours* Read the seed paper on protein disorder again. Researched about paper. Set up and used Mendeley and techniques from RMT to write a level 1 and some level 3 summary sections about the paper.

### 19 Oct 2022

* *3 hours* Read the DISOPRED paper and analysed it using RMT techniques (L1 and L2 summaries). Created questions to ask at the meeting about this paper.
* *2 hours* Read the DISOPRED3 paper and analysed it using RMT techniques.

### 20 Oct 2022

* *2 hours* Finishing analysing the DISOPRED3 paper and made questions from annotations Iâ€™d made.
* *1 hour* Meeting with Kevin. Discussed forming a dataset and current databases with disordered proteins.
* *1 hour* Wrote up detailed minutes after meeting.

### 23 Oct 2022
* *3.5 hours* Worked through most of lab 2 from DL moodle - "Experiments with basic networks and visualising the results".

### 24 Oct 2022
* *1 hour* Fixed GitHub.
