# Creating a server for protein disorder prediction based on deep neural networks.

## Project Description

A number of devastating neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's) are caused by disordered proteins that then form amyloids within the brain.

Some parts of proteins are prone to be disordered (without structure) which may cause disease, whereas other parts are often stable. We developed the popular DISOPRED method to determine regions of proteins which are often disordered.

This project proposes to examine how well deep neural networks do when predicting protein disorder. A variety of different architectures and approaches will be used and benchmarked against each other.

It is also proposed to develop a Django-based server that will allow someone to submit a protein sequence and graphically see areas of protein disorder.
